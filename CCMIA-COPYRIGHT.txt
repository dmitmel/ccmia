CCMIA's package repository contains various other people's projects.

Copies of these projects are hosted on the main repository mirror in a compressed,
 slightly unusual, but standardized format (see the DEFLATE RFC and TAR file format details),
 with any licensing details those projects have as part of their structure intact.

(This may cause installed copies of projects to overwrite each other's licensing information, however.)
